# Customer Segmentation Unsupervised Learning Project
This repo contains the Jupyter notebook used to create a set of unsupervised machine learning models trained to cluster customers and explore their engagement to various marketing campaigns. The data came from the [Customer Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishakhdapat/customer-segmentation-clustering/) dataset on Kaggle. This served as the final project in DTSA 5510: Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning at the University of Colorado Boulder.
